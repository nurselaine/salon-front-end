# Welcome to the Loann's Salon 

## Hair By Loann Overview

Loann is an independent hair stylist wanting to promote her business online. After failed attempts working with freelance web-developers, Loann's only way of connecting with new clients was through referrals and schedules appointments through text/email only. She wants to be able to create a website to attract new clients and for her old clients to use to contact her regarding appointment queries and also view her portfolio to showcase her expertise.
